# iRacing-SPI-dashboard-
iRacing dashboard for Waveshare xpt2046 Arduino screen.
This is my own personal dashboard project and thus might not be so user-friendly. To get the software to work put the cs files in the same folder and use an Arduino Mega 2560 with a Waveshare XPT 2046 screen. 
1. Plug in the Arduino
2. Start iRacing simulator and make sure you are in the car 
3. Start the C# program
4. Enjoy
